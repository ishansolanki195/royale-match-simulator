## Project Status

This project is in early-stage development.
The current implementation focuses on core simulation flow and baseline AI decision logic.
Upcoming updates will introduce adaptive strategies and richer game-state modeling.

Royale Sparring Bot is an AI-powered training agent designed to simulate high-skill friendly battle gameplay inspired by Clash Royale mechanics. The system is intended for practice, strategy validation, and AI research, offering human-like decision-making, adaptive deck logic, and realistic reaction timing in controlled sparring environments.
